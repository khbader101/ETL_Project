# ETL_Project

We as a group are proposing for our project to be based on the ETL method of data analysis. Extraction of locations from Mcdonald’s across the US and obesity rates in a sampled 500 cities. We will then Transform the data to match by matching the cities in both sets. Using Pandas to achieve this, we should be able to start up a relational database (pg Admin 4) to store the tables. This is the Loading step.

We believe this project to be straightforward in its goal of linking Mcdonald’s with their appropriate obesity rate in each city. A final product will be a database that can be used for obesity rates and a Mcdonald’s in the appropriate city.
